This is a webpage I built to showcase my portfolio of projects I have built. The site itself is a project entry as well!

## Technical Details

The site was built using Angular 16 and hosted via GitHub Pages.
<br>
It uses UI components from <a href="https://primeng.org/">PrimeNG</a> UI library.
<br>
Icons used in the Skills section were provided from <a href="https://devicon.dev/">Devicon</a>.
